1. Put down a code block and enter the code in ```code_block.js``` in the code block (don't forget to run the code block).

2. Press F8 on your keyboard and enter the code in ```world_code.js``` to your world code script.

# WARNING

The world code will give error everytime the server is reset (in other words, if you leave the server and rejoin with no one else in the server, the server resets). The only way to solve this problem is to run the code block, or set a ```press to excecute``` board to excecute the ```press to code``` board in front of the code block.
